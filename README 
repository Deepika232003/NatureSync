Nature-sync
This project aims to create a mobile app that helps users take better care of their plants.

The "Nature Sync" app helps you take care of your plants better. It uses your location to understand your local weather and environment. This helps it give you tips that fit your plants' needs, like when to water them or move them to a sunnier spot.

It's not just about monitoring, though. The app shares useful tips and tricks based on gardening experts' advice. You can set reminders for tasks like watering or fertilizing your plants. Plus, you can join a community of other plant lovers to share ideas and learn together.
